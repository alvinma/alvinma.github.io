              <p> It has been a while since I have gone on an oversea trip, and this trip was a huge success in my endevors
                as it had opened up my mind and made me want to travel to world a whole lot more. The culture, food, cleanliness,
                infrastructure; everything was astouding!! My experience in Japan makes me want to see what the rest of the world
                has to offer. Let me not bore you with any more details. Let me show you what I was able to capture during my
                experience in Japan... </p>

              <p>
                Insert a collage of awesome experiences of Japan here.
              </p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">On My Way to Japan!!</h2>
              <p> It has been a while since I had flown internationally, but this experience brought a wonderful experience!
                The greatest lesson I picked up was to travel with no, or close to none, expectations!! My flight was with
                United Airlines and my expectations on this flight was extremely low as I only heard about not so great things
                about flying with United Airlines, but even though I had the middle seat of a three seat row, it wasn't too bad.
                The mother and baby on my left was pretty nice and interesting to watch, the guy, Matthew, to my right was travelling
                to Tokyo only for the four day weekend for his girlfriend (True commitment right there!!), and I had a lot of movies
                and anime to watch!
              </p>

              <p> The food wasn't bad either! One of my concerns was that the food would be unbarable, but because of my low expectations,
                the food ended up being pretty edible. I was also served a lemon serbert for desert! It was too sweet and I was not able to
                finish it, but the effort was seriously appreciated. Overall, it was a descent flight. And on the plus side, Alladin live
                action movie was pretty entertaining to watch!
              </p>

              <p>
                Insert plane photo here.
              </p>

              <p> As soon as I landed in Tokyo, my adventure begins and I spent the rest of the day figuring out the infrastructure of Japan.
                The subway system was just simply impressive, but once you consistently take the train, you'll be able to master it in two days
                as there is literally only one line that you'll take over and over again. The Yamamoto Line for the WIN!
              </p>

              <p>
                <!-- photo of subway map and maybe other images-->
              </p>

              <p> To relinquish a crave I had since I last gone to Japan in 2007, I directly went to Ichiran Ramen, lined up for thirty minutes,
                and ordered the largest order they had! Yes! My first meal was Ichiran Ramen and it was delicious!!
              </p>

              <p>
                <!-- image of ichiran ramen -->
              </p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Sad Realization of Tokyo...</h2>
              <p> September 27th, 2019 - October 3rd, 2019</p>
              <p> On my first day at Toyko, I was excited to go out and roam the city in expectation that the city was similar in size to a nearby
                home city, San Francisco... After my first day of exploration, I was surprised to find out that Tokyo was nothing like San Francisco.
                Toyko was ENORMOUS compared to San Francisco! After some research, San Francisco is roughly 47 square miles (121.73 square kilometers),
                whereas Tokyo is roughly 845 square miles (2188.55 square kilometers)!! This was just estonishing! I was not able cover a piece of
                Tokyo in the day, and there was just so many activities happening everyday!
              </p>

              <p> Even after altering the Japan trip and removing Kitakata, the ramen city, from the itinery to spend more time in Japan, seven days was
                still not enough time to explore the entire city of Tokyo to the fullest! In the days I spent in Tokyo, I was only able to cover Shibuya,
                Shinjuku, Koto, Chiyoda, Chuo, Mitaka, and Musashino wards of Tokyo [Note: Wards are subdivisions of a city]. In a week's time, I was only
                able to hit up seven wards of Tokyo, and I still wasn't able to fully explore each one of them. There is just too many things that can be
                done in Japan! I just kept going back and forth between each ward each day just to keep up with what I booked and the unexpected
                festivities going on!
              </p>

              <p> In my adventures, I may have accidentally stumble upon Kawasaki City and ended up in the Kawasaki Ward for half a day. The area had more
                of a gambling feel to it. It may have been because I entered into multiple casinos out of curiosity of what kind of games they offer in
                Japan.
              </p>

              <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Shibuya</h4>
              <p> Shibuya was pretty amazing! It was pretty much a huge shopping district! There were so many things to see, buy, and eat!! This was the
                first spot I hit up a sushi restaurant and it was AMAZING! The dollar per plate deal for fresh fish was AMAZING! I would come back to
                Japan just for the food!
              </p>

              <p> With Shabuya, there is an All You Can Eat hotpot called Shabuya back at home, meaning that I just had to try the All You Can Eat hotpot
                here in Shabuya, Japan! They offer beef tongue as a dish in Japan and it was delicious!!
              </p>

              <p> I am not a big shopper, but there were so many stores around the area. Especially second-hand thrift shops. They had different style of
                clothing for days! Secondhand brand named clothes were sitting being glass cabinets for admiration purposes. It was very different from
                what I am accustomed to. <!--But to top it off, the main store that was surprising was the BICS Camera and Donqui Mega stores! These stores
                literally had everything you wanted. From the first floor to the eighth, there was nothing you couldn't find that you needed! -->
              </p>

              <p> Other places I found very interesting about Shabuya was that there was always an event going on. Everytime I visited Yoyogi Park, some kind
                of festival is going on. Out of the three times I have been to Shabuya and explored near Yoyogi Park, I was able to join in a world cultures,
                Indian, and street food market festivals! Shabuya was an area where the excitement does not seem to fade!
              </p>

              <p>
                <!-- Shibuya Ward -->
              </p>

              <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Shinjuku</h4>
              <p> Shinjuku consist of a beautiful Gyoen National Botanic Garden! The was just a vast area of green grass, trees, and a few greenhouses. People
                were setting up picnics or simply taking a nap in the fresh outdoors. It was an amazing place to be!
              </p>

              <p> Of course, there was the other side of Shinjuku. The red light district was pretty interesting and many activities occurs in this distric of
                Shinjuku. The Robot Restaurant which I had tickets for was in this district and as a tourist, it was one of the most exciting shows to watch!
                I loved it! But in the district itself, you'll have Japanese men in business suits or Nigerian men coming up to you, trying to get you to go to
                a specific bar. Honestly, I wanted to see what it felt like to be approach and hassled to go to a certain bar, but it was not as extreme as I
                had enticipated. This was probably due to the fact that the Rugby World Cup was going on in Japan and literally ALL the bars at this district
                was filled up by the fans.
              </p>

              <p>

              <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Koto</h4>
              <p> Koto ward was pretty fun! The monorail ran throughout the area and it felt like an open amusement park. Every station had something different
                going on and things to see. TeamLab Borderless, the fancy destination with all the lights, could be found here. A large ferris wheel can be
                taken here to have a view of the area. Odaiba Statue of Liberty Republic can be found here. The large two stories Gundam Unicorn can be found
                here; and if you waited long enough, you can witness the statue change modes!! There are many many gardens around the area. And finally, the
                Toyota showcase is here as well. This is where they display all their cars, 4D experinece rides, and future product demonstrations!
              </p>

              <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Chiyoda</h4>
              <p> I happened to stubble into Chiyoda City because I noticed a HUGE park in the middle of the city. After my first meal in Japan at Ichiran Ramen
                and munching on Mcdonald's fries, this park was refreshing to stroll through at night. It was a lot bigger than I expected and many of the park
                were closed off at night due to security reasons. Even so, I saw a lot of joggers and runners taking advantage of the openess of this park and
                taking a nightly job/run throughout the park. The nature plus patches of water made the area a nice place to visit. The Imperial Palace,
                Shin-Marunouchi Building, and Seimon Stonebridge were nice structures to be seen in this area.
              </p>

              <p> Another big attraction at Chiyoda Ward is the famous area for anime, Akihabara!! Anime could be seen everywhere!! There were specific kinds of
                anime and gaming cafes, stores with many figure displays, and people in cosplay walking around. The Japanese culture is very open, so if you think
                about what kind of anime figures, pillow, or cards you may want to find in these stores, you may actually find it.
              </p>

              <p> Akihabara is also known as the Electric City of Tokyo Japan as they have many electronics shops, game cafes, and arcades! Where ever you go, you
                will find a store with many electronic goods or a place with so many claw machines, you would not know how big the building actually is.. This
                district is a very interesting palce to visit.
              </p>

              <p>
                <!-- Chiyoda Ward -->
              </p>

              <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Chuo</h4>
              <p> I bypassed this area multiple times! Chuo ward is where the fish market and Tsukiji street market is held. There is a lot of fresh foods here, but
                I have to say, even though the street foods were priced higher than I expected, they tasted AMAZING!! Specifically, I was really shocked by how good
                the large shelled oysters tasted. It was the best oyster I've ever had and I couldn't find anything better elsewhere! Sadly, the fish market wasn't
                something I was expected to see, but if you are willing to wake up early enough, you may be able to witness the auction going on. This is something I
                tried a few times, but couldn't do...
              </p>

              <p>
                <!-- Chuo Ward -->
              </p>

              <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Mitaka/Musashino</h4>
              <p> Because I wanted to try an animal cafe, I ended up going to Inokashira Park in Mitaka Ward. It was the first park I visited in Japan during the day
                and it surprised me of how many families were having quality time together out at this park. With a big lake, there were swan paddle boat rides and
                families, couples, and friends were riding them throughout the lake as a casual stroll. It was really eye opening of the quality of life people in
                Japan has. Families are extremely active in Japan as well as I saw a lot of people doing physical activities with each other. Mothers were swining a
                jump rope for her kids, and fathers were doing push-ups with their son. The Ghibli Museum could be found here as well! When I accidentally found myself
                inside the museum without permission during closing (because I didn't know what I could access), I found it pretty funny how they had a giant Totoro at
                the entrance of the museum acting as a receptionist. The museum also had a real natural feeling to it as if it was abandoned and plants started growing
                along the walls of the museum. This museum is like a large playhouse, but no touching!
              </p>

              <p> After strolling through the park, I ended up going to Cat Cafe Temari no Ouchi in Musashino. As this was my second day in Japan, I was quite confused
                as to where I was going. You would find stores everywhere, but the confusing part was that stores would be on different levels. Using google maps helped
                me pinpoint the location of the Cat Cafe, but I ended up going back and forth until I realized that the cafe was on the third floor. This gave me quite
                the perspective of the country's infrastructure and assisted me locating many other spots in the city. At the end, I was able to meet some cute cats
                wearing costumes, enjoyed some window shopping, and learned a valuable lesson to always look up when finding a specific destination!
              </p>

              <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Kawasaki</h4>
              <p> When I stubbled into Kawasaki Ward accidentally, I was not expecting too much as the city was initially dead during the day. There wasn't as
                many people as I enticipated to be roaming around the city, but the riverbed between Tokyo and Kawasaki was pleasant to walk along. As I was about
                to leave the city near sundown, I started to notice a lot of people. Casinos were more visible and booming, shopping centers were on full display,
                and I accidentally ran into a mini waterfountain musical show! A mini Bellagio water show! The Kawasaki Ward simply reminded me of a smaller version
                of Las Vegas!
              </p>

              <p>October 3rd, 2019 - October 4th, 2019</p>
              <p> That's right!! In Japan, I experienced a life as a bum! A homeless person that slept at the bus stop/train station for the night! It was truly an
                an experience!
              </p>

              <p>October 4th, 2019 - October 6th, 2019</p>
              <p> Due to the homeless experience I had, I was not able to fully utilize my time at Mt. Fuji or Lake Kawaguchiko. Therefore, for the full day I had
                at Fujiyoshida area, I decided to rent a bike for the day and ride the 30 mile loop around Lake Kawaguchiko. This way, I would be able to get a
                picture of the lake with Mt. Fuji in it while being able to try out the local cuisines!

              <p>October 6th, 2019</p>
              <p> I had higher expecations for the bullet train, but it was a lot slower than I enticipated. Going at 200km/hr may be fast, but I was expecting it
                to go a tad bit faster over the years. Overall, the ride was smooth, I was able to sleep, and I was able to enjoy my bento boxes, which were amazing
                and an experience to have! Highly recommend the bento boxes in Japan for long traveling trips and picnics!!

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Hokkaido</h2>
              <p>October 6th, 2019 - October 10th, 2019</p>
              <p> Hakkkaido is one of the most natural places I have been to. Majority of the cities here are like small towns with small culture engulfed with lush
                green life. It is like a natural resort in every stay in Hokkaido.
              </p>

              <p> Hokkaido was prety much a planned relaxation day after a lot of exploration and binge eating that was done in Tokyo. With Hokkaido known to have
                the best spots for onsens (Hot Springs), these cities were the perfect last spots to hit! The plan was that we hit up the onsens in Hakodate, Toya,
                and Noroibetsu for the best onsen experiences while eating the best seafood in Japan, and end the trip with a shopping spree at Sapporo for gifts and
                the many goodies we could stuff in a bag to bring home. After walking between 18 - 26 miles (28.96 - 41.84 km) a day on the days prior, these was a
                grand treat to dip my toe in some hot water and relax.
              </p>

              <p> Granted that this was my first onsen experience and I was pretty shy and worrisome to the Japanese onsen customs, the experience was really pleasant!
                In all three different onsen experiences, I admit. I had my concerns with the traditional customs, but after dipping in the hot water, all worries goes
                away and nothing mattered anymore after a few minutes.
              </p>

              <p>Again, this was my first time and I didn't know what to expect in each experience, but my worries did not supsied because the onsen was very soothing
                and relaxing. It was soothing and relaxing, but it was too freaking HOT!!!! I was literally losing my mind sitting in the onsen, but the rest of my body
                was in such a relax state that I didn't want to move. It was such a weird and interesting experience.
              </p>

              <p> Now to talk about the food, I actually had the best experience in food experience in Hokkaido! Food was just amazing and I was able to sample on many of
                Hokkaido's delights!
              </p>

              <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Hakodate</h4>
              <p>October 6th, 2019 - October 7th, 2019</p>
              <p> Hakodate is a city known to have the best seafood in Japan, but what I discovered here was that the famous Shiyo Ramen in Hakodate was the best ramen I
                have ever tasted! The broth was super light, the wontons were small and flavorful, and the chasu was glissering with a good layer of fat. I would have to
                say that this light broth ramen beats wonton noodle soup and pho easily! It was extremely flavorful! The best quote/situation that I will never forget my
                friend had gone through; "I'm still so full from the bento boxes.. Let me finish only the wontons and chasu.." A few minutes later.. "WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL
                THE NOODLES!?!!?? THEY JUST DISAPPEARED!!! I HAD A LOT OF NOODLES LEFT!!!". This situation and more can fully describe how much I enjoyed this simple bowl
                of shiyo ramen!

              <p>October 7th, 2019 - October 8th, 2019</p>
              <p> Lake Toya was gorgeous, but what really made this town great, and also my Japan trip, was the awesome experience I had at Lake Toya Resort! From the customer
                service once we arrived to the hotel, to the cleanliness, to the decorations, to the western/eastern combo room, to the all you can eat dinner and breakfast
                buffer, to the amazing outdoors lake view hot spring. Everything was simply amazing and made one simple day a dream come true! From my experiences with the ~$200
                hotels per person back at home, the experience is pretty much mediocure, but in Japan, every penny spent was worth it! <!-- Lake Toya Resort was literally the best
                stay in my life that I wrote a seperate blog for it HERE. -->

              <p>October 8th, 2019 - October 9th, 2019</p>
              <p> Noboribetsu was a simple city, but this was the only time during the trip where the weather had limited what we were able to do. With the heavy rainfall, we
                simply stayed in our rooms, relaxed, and enjoyed the hot springs whenever we could. This city seemed a little too old fassioned for my taste, and I realized this
                after entering the onsen (hot spring) and finding A LOT of old men enjoying the onsen. I would be okay to work with a few, but this was an uncomfortable amount of
                old men huddled up in one small outdoors onsen. I would have to admit, the outdoor onsen had a beautiful view with a waterfall and a lot of Bonsai trees around, but
                with roughly twenty men huddled around in a onsen fully naked, this was just a bit too much. The indoor onsen was enormous and enjoyable, but it wasn't what I wanted
                to experience. Overall, this stay wasn't too bad and the all you can eat buffet was not as good as Lake Toya Resort, but it was stil better than any other buffets I
                have ever had!
              </p>

              <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Sapporo</h4>
              <p>October 9th, 2019 - October 10th, 2019</p>
              <p> With my trip coming to the end, Sapporo was designated as the day that I shop for everything I found and wanted! This was the time I started shopping for clothes, candy,
                snacks, unique electronics, and souvenirs. Of course, I had to tour the city first and see what the city had to offer! Moerenuma Park was the first stop I went to and it
                was pretty much the biggest interactive park I have been to. There were so many parks within this park! During the time I had gone, I climbed up Mt. Moere and the wind was
                strong enough to push me around if I did not shift my body weight around or sit down! I was quite amazed by the feeling as I am pretty heavy.
              </p>

              <p> Afterwards, it was time to explore for some food options, but firstly, I had to try some beer from the Sapporo Beer Museum. Here, I discovered that Sapporo Black Star beer
                brand was pretty tasty compared to the others. After drinking a few glasses of beer, it was time to fill up my stomach with food, and since it was my last day, I had to try
                everything I could think of! I was ready to binge eat again! Crepe was the first item in my stomach. Then the well known Sappro dish, Kangaskan lamb. And finally, more ramen!!
                It was a wonderful day where I shopped until 2am in the morning at the multiple Donqui Megastore.
              </p>

              <p> Did I forget to mention, I visited the Tanukikoji Shopping Arcade? This was basically a long, pedestrian only, shopping street that consists of 200 shops! The best part was,
                the hostel that was booked was conveniently in the center of this arcade! It was the best "shop and quickly unload" experience I had! My wallet was hit many times on this day..

              <p> It has been a while since I had flown internationally, but this experience brought a wonderful experience!
                I flew out on the morning of September 26th and landed in Japan noon of September 27th. It was a pleasant feel
                to leave the Americas and be engulfed by a new civilization immediately.</p>

              <p> Extentiate summary of first day experience.
                1. Experience getting to and at Hanna Hotel.
                2. Immediate adventure to Shinbashi for ichiran ramen, my first meal in Japan.
                3. Briefly throw in McDonald french fries experience. "only okay"
                4. Adventure towards Chiyoda city while waiting for my friend
                5. It was dark, but I walked around the imperial palace and crossed the Seimon Stonebridge without realizing it.
                      I was more distracted by the number of police station that was monitoring the area! And it was dark!
                6. I ended up going to the Shin-Marunouchi Building and realized that the Rugby world cup was being held in Japan.
                7. There was also a counter that indicated that the Olympics will be held in Japan next year! 300 days remains when I saw it.
                8. Afterwards, I was rejoined with my friend after getting lost in the station multiple times (It was big!)
                9. Peter and I went to the hotel and that's when we started experiencing the market food lifestyle! 7-11 and FamilyMart, we
                      went and started buying a bunch of food we wanted to try! Onigiris, ice cream, alcohol, and karage. My god!! The friend
                      chicken in Japan was the best I have ever had!! It was extremely JUICEY and it was 24/7 convenient store!!! LIKE WHAT!!?</p>

              <p> First revolving sushi experience in Japan and it was amazing!! Nigiris were less than $1 a plate and my friend and I continued
                to smash nigiris after nigiris into our face! It was an amazing treat to have! We moved onto the Donqui mega-mart
                experience after and I was not expecting how much stuff this one store had. It was amazing! Anything you needed, they
                had. And besides it was the BICS camera store which had all the electronics you would ever want. </p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Adventure to Hakodate and the night adventure.</h2>
              <p> Today is the day we leave Tokyo and head to Hakodate. While waiting for my friend to arrive, it
                    was my last change to eat everything I could in Japan. So I went back to Tsukiji Fish market
                    and ate the best oyster in my life!! It was a large shelled oyster as well, so I wasnt expecting
                    much from it, but it was AMAZING!! </p>

              <p> Before the ride to Hakodate Hokkaido, I loaded up on bento boxes to sample to great togo style lunches
                   Japan had to offer. Train ride slower than expected. Arrived at Hakodate. Had the best Ramen, and probably
                   the best dish in my entire experience at Japan. My new favorite soup noodle, the wonton shiyo ramen!!!!</p>

              <p> The adventure just doesn't end right there. The experience goes onto the pentagon park (TODO:::Search up real name).
                    Even at night, the park was gorgeous! It was a shame that the center of the park was closed off, and for the
                    fact that the park would look even better during autumn leave change or during the sakura season. But no matter,
                    the park was beautiful!!</p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Adventure towards Lake Toya</h2>
	            <p> Before going to lake toya, we decided to remain and try more food in hakodate before adventuring
                out. We ended up taking a small hike and eating the remainder of our bento boxes. We also tried some
                seafood in hakodate and I think we overhyped the experienced that was offered.</p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Lake Toya Resort Experience</h2>
	            <p> This resort was so amazing that I just had to give a whole section to this experience!
                Going to this resort would probably be the highlight of my Japan trip! It was the sole
                reason why I decided to develop this website and continue my travelling adventures! Having
                a lake view from my hotel room and my first japanese outdoor hot spring experience as well
                seriously made this stay a treat!</p>

	              <img src="images/image_1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">

              <p> From the customer services, to the lobby, to the room, to the buffet, and finally the
                hot spring, everything was just awesome! Immediately walking into the resort, we were
                pleasantly greeted to the lobby and then served a pleasant fruit drink with a cracker
                snack. When checking in, the Standard Twin Room that I booked was upgraded to the
                Deluxe Room with a Tatami Area. The upgraded room made the experience a whole lot
                better as it was a lot roomier with a mixture of both western and japanese style. </p>
