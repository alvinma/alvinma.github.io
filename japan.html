              <p> It has been a while since I have gone on an oversea trip, and this trip was a huge success in my endevors
                as it had opened up my mind and made me want to travel to world a whole lot more. The culture, food, cleanliness,
                infrastructure; everything was astouding!! My experience in Japan makes me want to see what the rest of the world
                has to offer. Let me not bore you with any more details. Let me show you what I was able to capture during my
                experience in Japan... </p>

              <p>
                Insert a collage of awesome experiences of Japan here.
              </p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">On My Way to Japan!!</h2>
              <p> It has been a while since I had flown internationally, but this experience brought a wonderful experience!
                The greatest lesson I picked up was to travel with no, or close to none, expectations!! My flight was with
                United Airlines and my expectations on this flight was extremely low as I only heard about not so great things
                about flying with United Airlines, but even though I had the middle seat of a three seat row, it wasn't too bad.
                The mother and baby on my left was pretty nice and interesting to watch, the guy, Matthew, to my right was travelling
                to Tokyo only for the four day weekend for his girlfriend (True commitment right there!!), and I had a lot of movies
                and anime to watch!
              </p>

              <p> The food wasn't bad either! One of my concerns was that the food would be unbarable, but because of my low expectations,
                the food ended up being pretty edible. I was also served a lemon serbert for desert! It was too sweet and I was not able to
                finish it, but the effort was seriously appreciated. Overall, it was a descent flight. And on the plus side, Alladin live
                action movie was pretty entertaining to watch!
              </p>

              <p>

              </p>

              <p> As soon as I landed in Tokyo, my adventure begins and I spent the rest of the day figuring out the infrastructure of Japan.
                The subway system was just simply impressive, but once you consistently take the train, you'll be able to master it in two days
                as there is literally only one line that you'll take over and over again. The Yamamoto Line for the WIN!
              </p>

              <p>
                <!-- photo of subway map and maybe other images-->
              </p>

              <p> To relinquish a crave I had since I last gone to Japan in 2007, I directly went to Ichiran Ramen, lined up for thirty minutes,
                and ordered the largest order they had! Yes! My first meal was Ichiran Ramen and it was delicious!!
              </p>

              <p>

              </p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Sad Realization of Tokyo...</h2>
              <p> On my first day at Toyko, I was excited to go out and roam the city in expectation that the city was similar in size to a nearby
                home city, San Francisco... After my first day of exploration, I was surprised to find out that Tokyo was nothing like San Francisco.
                Toyko was ENORMOUS compared to San Francisco! After some research, San Francisco is roughly 47 square miles (121.73 square kilometers),
                whereas Tokyo is roughly 845 square miles (2188.55 square kilometers)!! This was just estonishing! I was not able cover a piece of
                Tokyo in the day, and there was just so many activities happening everyday!
              </p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">The flight to Japan + arrival! </h2>
              <p> It has been a while since I had flown internationally, but this experience brought a wonderful experience!
                I flew out on the morning of September 26th and landed in Japan noon of September 27th. It was a pleasant feel
                to leave the Americas and be engulfed by a new civilization immediately.</p>

              <p> Extentiate summary of first day experience.
                1. Experience getting to and at Hanna Hotel.
                2. Immediate adventure to Shinbashi for ichiran ramen, my first meal in Japan.
                3. Briefly throw in McDonald french fries experience. "only okay"
                4. Adventure towards Chiyoda city while waiting for my friend
                5. It was dark, but I walked around the imperial palace and crossed the Seimon Stonebridge without realizing it.
                      I was more distracted by the number of police station that was monitoring the area! And it was dark!
                6. I ended up going to the Shin-Marunouchi Building and realized that the Rugby world cup was being held in Japan.
                7. There was also a counter that indicated that the Olympics will be held in Japan next year! 300 days remains when I saw it.
                8. Afterwards, I was rejoined with my friend after getting lost in the station multiple times (It was big!)
                9. Peter and I went to the hotel and that's when we started experiencing the market food lifestyle! 7-11 and FamilyMart, we
                      went and started buying a bunch of food we wanted to try! Onigiris, ice cream, alcohol, and karage. My god!! The friend
                      chicken in Japan was the best I have ever had!! It was extremely JUICEY and it was 24/7 convenient store!!! LIKE WHAT!!?</p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Tokyo Experience - September 27th - October 1st?? - Shabuya district</h2>
              <p> First revolving sushi experience in Japan and it was amazing!! Nigiris were less than $1 a plate and my friend and I continued
                to smash nigiris after nigiris into our face! It was an amazing treat to have! We moved onto the Donqui mega-mart
                experience after and I was not expecting how much stuff this one store had. It was amazing! Anything you needed, they
                had. And besides it was the BICS camera store which had all the electronics you would ever want. </p>
              <p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Adventure to Hakodate and the night adventure.</h2>
              <p> Today is the day we leave Tokyo and head to Hakodate. While waiting for my friend to arrive, it
                    was my last change to eat everything I could in Japan. So I went back to Tsukiji Fish market
                    and ate the best oyster in my life!! It was a large shelled oyster as well, so I wasnt expecting
                    much from it, but it was AMAZING!! </p>

              <p> Before the ride to Hakodate Hokkaido, I loaded up on bento boxes to sample to great togo style lunches
                   Japan had to offer. Train ride slower than expected. Arrived at Hakodate. Had the best Ramen, and probably
                   the best dish in my entire experience at Japan. My new favorite soup noodle, the wonton shiyo ramen!!!!</p>

              <p> The adventure just doesn't end right there. The experience goes onto the pentagon park (TODO:::Search up real name).
                    Even at night, the park was gorgeous! It was a shame that the center of the park was closed off, and for the
                    fact that the park would look even better during autumn leave change or during the sakura season. But no matter,
                    the park was beautiful!!</p>
              <p>

              </p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Adventure towards Lake Toya</h2>
	            <p> Before going to lake toya, we decided to remain and try more food in hakodate before adventuring
                out. We ended up taking a small hike and eating the remainder of our bento boxes. We also tried some
                seafood in hakodate and I think we overhyped the experienced that was offered.</p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Lake Toya Resort Experience</h2>
	            <p> This resort was so amazing that I just had to give a whole section to this experience!
                Going to this resort would probably be the highlight of my Japan trip! It was the sole
                reason why I decided to develop this website and continue my travelling adventures! Having
                a lake view from my hotel room and my first japanese outdoor hot spring experience as well
                seriously made this stay a treat!</p>
	            <p>
	              <img src="images/image_1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
	            </p>
              <p> From the customer services, to the lobby, to the room, to the buffet, and finally the
                hot spring, everything was just awesome! Immediately walking into the resort, we were
                pleasantly greeted to the lobby and then served a pleasant fruit drink with a cracker
                snack. When checking in, the Standard Twin Room that I booked was upgraded to the
                Deluxe Room with a Tatami Area. The upgraded room made the experience a whole lot
                better as it was a lot roomier with a mixture of both western and japanese style. </p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold"> Day at Noroibetsu Hot Spring resort </h2>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold"> Day at Sapporo </h2>
              <p> Day at Sapporo - extreme winds, beer museum, karaage crepe, skillet lamb (kangaskan),
                    hostel right in the middle of the arcade shopping center, best ramen in Sapporo, and
                    the final shopping spree experience. Saw a random person passed out in the basement.</p>

              <p> talk about the final day and the flight back home. The day I time travelled back into time!
                    I flew out on October 10th noon, just to land back in California at 9am on Octover 10th! </p>

	            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Lessons I learned not to do next time!!</h2>
	            <p>TRAVEL LIGHT!!! Lugging around 2 bags was hell!!!</p>
              <p>Book one place for each city!! Jumping around apartments is not ideal!</p>

              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Ending Summary of the trip</h2>
              <p>Overall, this trip was AMAZING!! I am currently planning on travelling back to Japan once
                a year just for food thanks to this experience!</p>
